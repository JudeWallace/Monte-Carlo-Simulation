# Monte Carlo Simulation
This repoistory contains the code to run the Monte Carlo simulation, initialised with a stock priced at Â£100 and accepting and validating user inputs for the bounds of the Number of Steps (S) and Number of Walks (W) of the simulation. The result is a table containing the prices and there respecitive probabilites outputted by the Monte Carlo simulation.

## Requirements
To run the application <b>Java 22</b> will need to be installed locally. This is the only manual requirement all other depencies are handled with maven.

## How to Use
### Option 1 - .jar file
  I have emailed a copy of the .jar for easier download, alternatively I have a jar included in the repository.
  - Step 1: Navigate in a terminal to the directory the jar has been downlaoaded into
  - Step 2: Enter the following command:
   ``` bash
java -jar Monte-Carlo-Simulation.jar
```

### Option 2 - locally compiling project and running
